# Roster

The purpose of this project was to take an array of strings containing information about students and implement a roster application.
The program creates separate classes for various types of students. 
Functions were also created to allow for searching and manipulation of student data.

This project was created in an undergraduate scripting and programming class that focused on the basics of object oriented programming. 
This is my first programming project and contains the first lines of code I have ever written.
